# Improvement Plan for KMeans Clustering Model

## 1. Feature Engineering
- Explore additional features from the dataset that may enhance clustering performance.
- Consider creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., combining features, creating interaction terms).

## 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Experiment with different values for `n_clusters` beyond the current range (1-10).
- Test different initialization methods and random states for KMeans.

## 3. Alternative Clustering Algorithms
- Evaluate the performance of other clustering algorithms such as:
  - DBSCAN
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- Compare results with KMeans to determine the best approach.

## 4. Scaling Features
- Normalize or standardize the feature set before applying KMeans to improve clustering results.
- Use techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Standardization (Z-score normalization).

## 5. Visualization Enhancements
- Add more visualizations to assess clustering quality, such as silhouette scores or pair plots.
- Create visualizations for alternative clustering methods to compare results.

## 6. Model Evaluation
- Implement metrics to evaluate clustering performance, such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc.
- Analyze the stability of clusters across different runs and parameter settings.
